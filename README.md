# Tim's Tiny Technical Test

This is a simple technical test that attempts to reach as specified targets as possible.
## Goals achieved
* Have a single-page application that:
  * Show nine (9) random strips from XKCD
  * Display strips as a 3x3 grid on large screens
  * Display strips as a 1x9 grid on small screen
  * Has a Refresh button that shows 9 new random strips
* Have a server that acts a proxy for XKCD's JSON API
* Clean and consistent coding style
  * Except for `bin/www` which was generated by PHPStorm for ease of development
* Documentation
* Uploaded to GitHub

## Goals missed
* Unit Tests
  * I've never learnt to make unit tests.
  * I want to make it obvious that this is where my limits are at currently

## Installation

### Requirements
* Node 9.11.1

Clone this git. Then from the base directory, run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

From the base directory, run the following command:
